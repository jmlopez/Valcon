What is Valcon?
--
Valcon is a framework that provides Validation by Convention. 

> Note: If you're browsing the source code and find yourself feeling like you're looking at StructureMap, it's because the initial spike of Valcon was slightly rushed and also served as a bit of a exploration into DSLs.


Where is CommonAssemblyInfo.cs?
--

CommonAssemblyInfo.cs is generated by the build. The build script requires Ruby with rake installed.

1. Run `InstallGems.bat` to get the ruby dependencies (only needs to be run once per computer)
1. open a command prompt to the root folder and type `rake` to execute rakefile.rb

If you do not have ruby:

1. You need to manually create a src\CommonAssemblyInfo.cs file 

  * type: `echo // > src\CommonAssemblyInfo.cs`
1. open src\FubuMVC.sln with Visual Studio and Build the solution
